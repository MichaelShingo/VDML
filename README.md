# VDML - Vitale Digital Media Lab App

Welcome to the Vitale Digital Media Lab App. This web application helps automate repetitive parts of the lab consultants' job including sending late equipment emails, processing late fines, and analyzing booking data.

The application is written in Python using Flask. It uses the Jinja2 templating engine to receive data from the Python backend and display HTML pages. On the frontend, there is minimal use of Javascript for DOM manipulation, and SCSS for styling. The app is deployed on pythonanywhere.com but is not publically accessible.

Because the app is hosted on a free account, it must be refreshed at least once every three months, or it will be taken offline.

If changes need to be made, contact Michael Shingo Crawford and request to be added to this Github repo as a collaborator. From there, you can clone the repo, make your changes, and make a pull request. I will review the request before merging.
